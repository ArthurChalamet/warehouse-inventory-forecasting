# Warehouse Inventory Forecasting

This is a data analysis project focused on warehouse operations.  
I worked on identifying patterns in stock levels, predicting shortages, and creating tools that help manage inventory more efficiently.

The idea came from my own experience working with warehouse teams and developing tools to support them.  
In this project, I simulate typical warehouse data and go through the full cycle: from raw data to insights and visualizations.

## Goal

To build a forecasting tool that helps prevent stockouts and supports better decision-making in inventory management.

Structure

- `data/` — raw and cleaned datasets (simulated)
- `notebooks/` — full Jupyter notebook with analysis and visualizations
- `dashboards/` — screenshots or links to Power BI dashboards
- `sql/` — queries used for summarizing and extracting insights
- `reports/` — summary report (PDF or Markdown)

## 📓 Notebooks

- [Inventory analysis](notebooks/inventory_analysis.ipynb): exploring volume, weight and packaging efficiency.


## Tools used

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn)
- SQL (PostgreSQL-style)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook

## What I did

- Cleaned and explored historical order and stock data
- Created logic for flagging low-stock items based on sales trends
- Built visualizations showing stock movement and demand
- Designed a dashboard mockup in Power BI (based on the analysis)
